# Extensibility Points for Your RAG Chatbot Agent

## Choosing the Right Model for the Right Case

- **Extension:** Experiment with different Ollama LLMs (e.g., specialized code models, larger general-purpose models) and embedding models.
- **Customization:** Update config.yaml to easily swap models. Evaluate model performance (accuracy, speed, resource usage) for your specific use cases.
- **Benefit:** Optimize response quality, speed, and resource efficiency based on the domain and complexity of questions.

## Building Custom Document Processing

- **Extension:** Enhance src/document_loader.py to handle more complex document types (e.g., Markdown, JSON with specific parsing rules, scanned PDFs with OCR) or to extract specific metadata.
- **Customization:** Implement custom DocumentLoader classes or pre-processing steps to clean, enrich, or structure data before chunking.
- **Benefit:** Improve retrieval accuracy by ensuring high-quality, well-structured data in the vector database, tailored to your information needs.

## Ingesting More Diverse Data Sources

- **Extension:** Expand src/document_loader.py to pull data from dynamic sources like APIs, databases (SQL/NoSQL), cloud storage (S3, GCS), or real-time feeds.
- **Customization:** Add new type entries in config.yaml for these sources and implement corresponding loading logic.
- **Benefit:** Keep the knowledge base continuously updated and comprehensive, enabling the chatbot to answer questions on the latest information.

## Enhancing Chatbot Security and User Experience

- **Security:** Implement user authentication (e.g., Streamlit's native authentication, or integrate with Firebase/OAuth for multi-user scenarios), role-based access control for data sources, and input sanitization.
- **User-Friendliness:** Improve the Streamlit UI with features like:
- **Conversational Memory:** Integrate LangChain's ConversationBufferMemory to allow follow-up questions.
- **Streaming Responses:** Fine-tune app.py for smoother, token-by-token streaming of LLM output.
- **Feedback Mechanism:** Add a simple "thumbs up/down" button for user feedback on responses to enable continuous improvement.
- **Source Display Enhancement:** Make source document display more interactive (e.g., click to view full document, filter by source type).
- **Benefit:** Create a more robust, engaging, and trustworthy application for end-users.

## Advanced RAG Techniques

- **Extension:** Explore more sophisticated retrieval strategies within src/rag_chain.py such as:
- **Query Transformation:** Rewriting user queries for better retrieval (e.g., HyDE, multi-query retriever).
- **Re-ranking:** Using a separate model to re-rank initial retrieval results for higher relevance.
- **Contextual Compression:** Condensing retrieved documents to fit LLM context windows more efficiently.
- **Benefit:** Significantly improve the relevance and quality of the context provided to the LLM, leading to more accurate and nuanced answers.

## Deployment and Scalability

- **Extension:** Containerize the application using Docker for easier deployment.
- **Scalability:** Consider deploying Ollama on a dedicated server with GPU for better performance, and hosting the Streamlit app on platforms like Streamlit Community Cloud, Hugging Face Spaces, or a cloud VM.
- **Benefit:** Make the chatbot accessible to a wider audience and handle increased usage.
